      <strong className="text-danger">Rick and Morty</strong> is an American
      adult animated science fiction sitcom created by Justin Roiland and Dan
      Harmon for Cartoon Network's late-night programming block Adult Swim. The
      series follows the misadventures of cynical mad scientist
      <strong className="text-warning"> Rick Sanchez</strong> and his
      good-hearted but fretful grandson
      <strong className="text-warning"> Morty Smith</strong>, who split their
      time between domestic life and interdimensional adventures. Roiland voices
      the eponymous characters, with Chris Parnell, Spencer Grammer and Sarah
      Chalke voicing the rest of Rick and Morty's family. The series originated
      from an animated short parody film of Back to the Future, created by
      Roiland for Channel 101, a short film festival co-founded by Harmon. The
      series has been acclaimed by critics for its originality, creativity and
      humor.
